# Problem 4

We leverage the scenario in **Problem 2** with the following extensions.

- Convert the domain defined in **Problem 2** to use durative actions. Choose arbitrary (but reasonable durations) for the different actions.
- Consider the possibility to have actions to be executed in parallel when this would be possible in reality.

For example, a robotic agent cannot pick up several *boxes* at the same time, or pick up a *box* and fly to a destination at the same time.

The initial condition and the goal are the same as the problem discussed in **Problem 2**.
